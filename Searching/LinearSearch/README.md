In linear search, we look for an element/key from the beginning till the end of a given list. <br>

    loop(start to end of list/array)
    
	    {
    
		    if (currentElement equals to key)
    
			    {
    
				    //perform some action
    
			    }
	    }
    
 In example.js, we find for a given element/key in an array and print the position of the array element.
